I promise, I promise. This is the year I'll start blogging, I'm choosing a topic and moving things around for my very first article... yeah, this doesn't count I'm gonna delete it later, so stay tune.

Some code here to check it `works`.

```js
function startBlogging() {
  console.log('No just yet... But soon.')
}

startBlogging()
```
